### Overview
This balloon launch used a T-Beam LoRa Tracker with a new dipole antenna to increase gain. It also hosted a redesigned bear drop mechanism that supports the increased weight of Grand Slam, our spacesuit wearing bear. This new system is still based on nichrome cutdowns, but we added a pvc pipe and more complex rigging to prevent the bear or parachute from moving around too much below the payload box. 

### Mission Summary
Primary Mission: **Success!**
The balloon was launched on schedule with the trackers and cameras operating. Grand Slam's selfie stick FPV camera gave amazing views at launch, and the backup trackers allowed an easy recovery in an empty field.  
  
Secondary Mission: **Failed**. The T-Beam shutdown at about 12,500m, leading to loss of signal for the bear cutdown mechanism, and Grand Slam came down safely still connected to the main payload box.

### Mission Objectives
* Test LoRa communications with improved antennas, less free space loss at 433MHz vs 915MHz, and a ground station amplifier.
* Move the USB Key fob camera inside the pay load container to avoid thermal concerns.

* Launch and Chase: Hojo/KD2EAT and Zach/KC3VAT

### Launch and Recovery

#### Launch
We filled the balloon a lot to target a faster ascent and descent rate since winds were quite high.

#### Actual track vs projected track

### Payload

#### Temperature
The payload temperature dropped to about -50c at 12000m. This caused the T-Beam tracker to shutdown, causing loss of signal. The other trackers remained operational, though the battery voltage did drop considerably due to the temperature. It rebounded as the temps came back up.

#### Camera
The Action Cameras performed very well. The FPV camera provided great shots at takeoff and recovery.

#### Recovery

The balloon landed in an empty field. We were able to easily retrieve it after gaining landowner permission.

### Lessons Learned

* The T-Beam is more sensitive to temperature than we realized, so we will move it inside the styrofoam for our next launch.
* The GPS antenna we used on this launch works much better than any we have used before. This may be due to a shorter length wire.
