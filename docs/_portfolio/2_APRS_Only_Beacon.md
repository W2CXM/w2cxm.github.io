### Mission Objectives
* Lower cost payload, involving less risk.
* Gain experience with prediction software and confirm its accuracy.
* Learn to use hydrogen as a lifting gas for cost savings and eco-friendliness.
* Learn the range of the APRS tracker.
* Enhance the ham club's experience and preparedness for APRS tracking.
* Attempt NVIS communications over 40m HF during launch.
* Attempt mobile cross-band repeater operations during launch.

* Note: Hydrogen was planned, but we discovered at the last minute that we needed a regulator that would not be available in time. We fell back to helium.

### Balloon Prediction Input

| [Predictor](http://predict.habhub.org/)    |           | 	                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------| ------------------------------------------|
| Payload Mass                               |           | 50g                                       |
| Balloon Mass                               |           | 200g Kaymont                              |
| Total Mass                                 |           | 250g (underestimated for prediction - actual was 281) |
| Target Ascent Rate                         |           | 5.75 m/s                                  |
| Descent Rate                               |           | 8 m/s                                     |
| Gas                                        |           | Helium                                    |
| Burst Diameter                             |           | 2.4m                                      |
| Start Location                             |           | Trial and error, aiming for southeast of Ithaca |

*Note: The predictor does not have 150g balloons, so we used a 200, deducted 50g from the payload weight, and specified an explicit burst diameter based on manufacturer specs.
